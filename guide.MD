# Odyssey Voyage I

## Overview

Odyssey Voyage I is an educational project designed to teach developers how to build a full-stack GraphQL application using Apollo. It covers the basics of setting up a GraphQL server, querying and mutating data, and integrating the server with a client application. The project also introduces the concept of GraphQL Federation, which allows multiple GraphQL services to be composed into a single, unified graph.

## Key Components

### GraphQL Server

- Built using Apollo Server.
- Provides a schema with type definitions and resolvers.
- Connects to a data source (typically a database or REST API).

### GraphQL Client

- Built using Apollo Client.
- Integrates with a front-end framework (usually React).
- Handles queries and mutations to interact with the GraphQL server.

### Schema Definition

- Defines the types, queries, and mutations for the application.
- Typically includes types for users, posts, comments, etc.

### Resolvers

- Functions that handle the logic for fetching and manipulating data.
- Connect the schema with the data source.

### Client-Side Integration

- Uses Apollo Client to fetch and update data from the GraphQL server.
- Manages local state and cache to optimize performance and user experience.

### Federation

- Introduces Apollo Federation to create a distributed graph.
- Allows multiple GraphQL services to be composed into a single graph.
- Utilizes a gateway to unify the subgraphs and provide a seamless API for clients.
- Includes schema stitching and resolver composition techniques.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of GraphQL.
- Set up and configure Apollo Server.
- Define a GraphQL schema with types, queries, and mutations.
- Implement resolvers to handle data fetching and manipulation.
- Integrate Apollo Client with a React application.
- Perform queries and mutations from the client-side.
- Manage local state and cache with Apollo Client.
- Learn and implement Apollo Federation to compose a distributed graph.
- Set up a gateway to unify multiple GraphQL services.

## Final Folder

- Contains the final version of the project.
- Includes a fully functional GraphQL server, client application, and federated services.
